# Shoesie WishList

### An app that tracks the lastest hottest shoes

## Overview

For project 3, I created an app that allows a user to track the latest shoes which are picked out by me, Chris Ducote, and allows the user to keep the shoes they have their eye on in mind.

Once the user loads the home page, they are presented with a brief bio of the app, and the option to Login and move forward if they wish to. After the user creates a new profile, or selects an existing user's profile, the user can then see Chris's Top Picks, and view a list of hand picked shoes. Once the user clicks the favorite button, that shoe is then stored in their wish list on their user profile page.
